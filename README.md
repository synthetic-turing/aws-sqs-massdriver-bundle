AWS SQS Pub/Sub Subscription is an encrypted SQS Queue designed for Pub/Sub fan-out messaging with AWS SNS.


---

## Design

For detailed information, check out our [Operator Guide](operator.mdx) for this bundle.

## Usage

Our bundles aren't intended to be used locally, outside of testing. Instead, our bundles are designed to be configured, connected, deployed and monitored in the [Massdriver][website] platform.

### What are Bundles?

Bundles are the basic building blocks of infrastructure, applications, and architectures in [Massdriver][website]. Read more [here](https://docs.massdriver.cloud/concepts/bundles).

## Bundle

### Params

Form input parameters for configuring a bundle for deployment.

## Properties

- **`monitoring`** *(object)*
  - **`mode`** *(string)*: Enable and customize SQS metric alarms. Default: `AUTOMATED`.
    - **One of**
      - Automated
      - Custom
      - Disabled
- **`queue`** *(object)*
  - **`additional_access`** *(array)*: Allow additional accounts to read from this queue. Default: `[]`.
    - **Items** *(string)*
  - **`max_message_size`** *(integer)*: The limit of how many bytes a message can contain before Amazon SQS rejects it. Minimum: `1024`. Maximum: `262144`. Default: `262144`.
  - **`message_retention_seconds`** *(integer)*: How long Amazon SQS retains a message. Minimum: `60`. Maximum: `1209600`. Default: `345600`.
  - **`region`** *(string)*: Region should generally be set to the same as the publisher topic. Selecting a different region will enable multi-region mode.

      "monitoring": {
          "mode": "AUTOMATED"
      },
      "queue": {

## Properties

      ```json
      "arn:aws:ec2::ACCOUNT_NUMBER:vpc/vpc-foo"
      ```

    - **`external_id`** *(string)*: An external ID is a piece of data that can be passed to the AssumeRole API of the Security Token Service (STS). You can then use the external ID in the condition element in a role's trust policy, allowing the role to be assumed only when a certain value is present in the external ID.
  - **`specs`** *(object)*
    - **`aws`** *(object)*: .
      - **`region`** *(string)*: AWS Region to provision in.

            ```

      - **`identity`** *(object)*: For instances where IAM policies must be attached to a role attached to an AWS resource, for instance AWS Eventbridge to Firehose, this attribute should be used to allow the downstream to attach it's policies (Firehose) directly to the IAM role created by the upstream (Eventbridge). It is important to remember that connections in massdriver are one way, this scheme perserves the dependency relationship while allowing bundles to control the lifecycles of resources under it's management.

### Bug Reports & Feature Requests

Did we miss something? Please [submit an issue](https://github.com/massdriver-cloud/aws-sqs-pubsub-subscription/issues) to report any bugs or request additional features.

### Developing

**Note**: Massdriver bundles are intended to be tightly use-case scoped, intention-based, reusable pieces of IaC for use in the [Massdriver][website] platform. For this reason, major feature additions that broaden the scope of an existing bundle are likely to be rejected by the community.

Still want to get involved? First check out our [contribution guidelines](https://docs.massdriver.cloud/bundles/contributing).

### Fix or Fork

If your use-case isn't covered by this bundle, you can still get involved! Massdriver is designed to be an extensible platform. Fork this bundle, or [create your own bundle from scratch](https://docs.massdriver.cloud/bundles/development)!
